          <div>
              <p>On December 31, 2024, version 1.0.1 of the modern
              terminal emulator <a
              href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty">Ghostty</a>
              was released that patched a code execution vulnerability,
              now tracked as <a
              href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-5hcq-3j4q-4v6p">CVE-2024-56803</a>.
              While terminals execute commands by design, this
              vulnerability allowed for unintended command execution
              through the title reporting escape sequence
              <code>(\e[21t)</code>.</p>
              <p>This occurred because the escape sequence inserted the
              window title directly into the command line. If the user
              pressed Enter, the inserted title would be executed as a
              command.</p>
              <p>For example, it was possible to launch the calculator
              by modifying the title using
              <code>\e]2;&lt;title&gt;</code>, where
              <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is the command, such as
              gnome-calculator. When combined with the title reporting
              escape sequence, the title would be inserted into the
              command line in the format <code>l&lt;title&gt;</code>,
              where <code>l</code> denotes that the subsequent string is
              the window title.</p>
              <p>However, Ghostty dynamically updates the window title
              after every executed command to reflect the current
              working directory. This behaviour interfered with the
              exploit by overriding the title that we controlled with a
              string containing the updated path.</p>
              <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F4VwM3Nk/1.png" /></p>
              <p>To bypass this, we could merge the title setting
              sequence and the title reporting sequence into a single
              sequence, preventing Ghostty from updating the title
              before the payload got inserted into the command line.</p>
              <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/yB87s91P/2.png" /></p>
              <p>Another issue that arose was that the inserted title
              was prefixed with <code>l</code>, preventing execution of
              the command. While this character could not be removed, a
              workaround was found where would prepend a semicolon
              <code>(;)</code> to the payload. This would make Bash
              interpret the inserted title as two separate commands as
              the semicolon is a command separator.</p>
              <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/fY0zj9vm/3.png" /></p>
              <p>This payload could be delivered by having it stored in
              a file and having a user <code>cat</code> it or fetch it
              using <code>curl</code>. But most users won't press Enter
              when they see that commands have been inserted into their
              command line.</p>
              <p>Therefore, a payload can be crafted where
              <code>\e[8m</code> is used to make the malicious command
              invisible, along with a fake error message that is
              displayed to deceive the user into pressing "Enter".</p>
              <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bgwSFhhF/4.png" /></p>
              <p>There are ongoing discussions about whether terminal
              emulator developers or CLI/TUI tool developers should be
              blamed for allowing escape sequences to be parsed when
              they are not needed. In the meantime, it is crucial to
              address the fact that escape sequences, an old technology
              that has not been updated, poses as a security risk.
              Therefore, it is important that user input is always
              sanitised to prevent users from being compromised.</p>
