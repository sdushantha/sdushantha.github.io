          <b>ANSI Escape Injection Vulnerability in WinRAR</b><br/>
          <i>Published on 21.05.2024</i>

          <div>
              <p>On 28 February 2024, RARLAB released an update for
              WinRAR, patching an ANSI escape sequence injection
              vulnerability that I had found in the console versions of
              RAR and UnRAR, affecting versions 6.24 and earlier. This
              vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2024–33899 for Linux and
              Unix systems and CVE-2024–36052 for the Windows, allowed
              attackers to spoof screen output or cause denial of
              service (in Linux and Unix). This vulnerability was
              patched in version 7.00. It’s important to note that the
              GUI version of WinRAR and the UnRAR library were not
              impacted by this vulnerability, regardless of the
              version.</p>
              <p>In this post, I will walk you through how this
              vulnerability works and demonstrate a proof of concept.
              While I will be showcasing this on a Linux system, the
              same can be done on a Windows or Unix system.</p>
              <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
              <p>If you are familiar with the Linux, Unix or Windows
              command line, chances are that you’ve encountered programs
              like <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">Vim</a> and <a
              href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/">Neofetch</a>.
              These programs use ANSI escape sequences to modify the
              text and background color, control the cursor, and create
              <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240524111033/https://github.com/Textualize/textual">GUI
              within the terminal</a>.</p>

              <p>Even though ANSI escape sequences can be used to create
              fancy terminal programs, it can also be weaponized, as
              shown in <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T2Al3jdY38">Stok
              Fredrik’s DEFCON talk</a>.</p>
              <p>WinRAR provides console RAR and UnRAR which can be use
              to create and extract RAR archives. As shown in the image
              below, RAR files support comments, that gets displayed
              when listing the contents of the archive file using
              <code>unrar l demo.rar</code>.</p>
              <p><img
              src="https://i.ibb.co/GfVsScf9/comment-demo.png" /></p>
              <p>In order to check if ANSI escape sequences are filtered
              out in the comment section, we can use a simple payload
              that will display <code>THIS IS GREEN</code> in the color
              green.</p>
              <pre><code>printf &#39;Hello \033[32mTHIS IS GREEN\033[0m\007&#39; | rar c demo.rar</code></pre>
              <p>Upon executing <code>rar l demo.rar</code>, we are able
              to see that <code>THIS IS GREEN</code> is outputted in
              green. This shows that the comment field does not filter
              ANSI escape sequences in the output.</p>
              <p><img

              <p><strong>Exploitation</strong></p>
              <p>This vulnerability can be exploited in many various
              ways but an exploit suited for WinRAR will be used as a
              demonstration.</p>
              <p>First, we will put our <code>virus.exe</code> file
              inside an <code>rar</code> file:</p>
              <pre class="console"><code>$ ls 
virus.exe
$ rar a demo.rar virus.exe</code></pre>
              <p>Next, we will add the following payload to the comment
              section:</p>
              <pre class="bash"><code>printf &#39;Archive: demo.rar\nDetails: RAR 5\n\nAttributes      Size       Date   Time   Name\n----------- ---------  ---------- -----  ---------\n-rw-r--r--          7  2024-05-19 16:26  notvirus.pdf\n----------- ---------  ---------- -----  ---------\n                    7                    1\e[8m&#39; | rar c demo.rar</code></pre>
              <p>This payload includes a fake listing where
              <code>virus.exe</code> is replaced with
              <code>notvirus.pdf</code>. The ANSI escape sequence
              <code>\e[8m</code> is used to hide all content after the
              comment section in the output. As a result, the actual
              file listing is hidden, and our fake file listing is
              displayed. In the screenshot below, you can see a large
              gap between the output and the shell prompt. This gap is
              due to the original file listing being outputted but
              rendered invisible using <code>\e[8m</code>. While
              experienced command line users may find this suspicious,
              less experienced users could easily be tricked.</p>
              <p><img

              <p>As mentioned at the beginning of this post, there are
              two CVEs associated with this vulnerability due to its
              significantly higher severity on Linux and Unix systems
              compared to Windows. This is because on Linux and Unix
              systems, certain ANSI escape sequences can be used to
              achieve a local denial of service.</p>
              <p>The payload below, which is taken from <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240524111033/https://i.blackhat.com/BH-US-23/Presentations/US-23-stok-weponizing-plain-text-ansi-escape-sequences-as-a-forensic-nightmare-appendix.pdf">Stok
              Fredrik’s Black Hat slides</a>, captures all cursor
              movements and outputs the coordinates to the terminal.
              This only works on Linux and Unix systems. When tested on
              a Kali Linux VM, the cursor coordinates were outputted to
              the terminal and the VM later ended up being frozen.</p>
              <pre class="bash"><code>\033[?1001h\033[?1002h\033[?1003h\033[?1004h\033[?1005h\033[?1006h\033[?1007h\033[?1015h\033[?10016h\</code></pre>
              <p>Despite the limited research on ANSI escape sequences,
              it’s evident that attackers with a deep understanding of
              ANSI escape sequences can exploit them in a creative,
              malicious and sometimes even annoying ways.</p>
